An open source public good built with [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/) to help developers maintain privacy on Solana.

Analyzes wallets, transactions, and programs using public on-chain data and produces deterministic privacy risk reports. Zero configuration required.

**Current Version:** `0.6.1` - [Changelog](./docs/changelog.md)

---

## Quick Start

### CLI

```bash
npm install -g solana-privacy-scanner

# Scan a wallet
solana-privacy-scanner scan-wallet <ADDRESS>

# Scan a transaction
solana-privacy-scanner scan-transaction <SIGNATURE>

# Scan a program
solana-privacy-scanner scan-program <PROGRAM_ID>

# Analyze source code for privacy anti-patterns
solana-privacy-scanner analyze src/**/*.ts
```

No setup required - includes a built-in RPC endpoint powered by [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/).

### Library

```bash
npm install solana-privacy-scanner-core
```

```typescript
import {
  RPCClient,
  collectWalletData,
  normalizeWalletData,
  generateReport,
  createDefaultLabelProvider
} from 'solana-privacy-scanner-core';

const rpc = new RPCClient(); // built-in RPC, no config needed
const rawData = await collectWalletData(rpc, 'WALLET_ADDRESS');
const context = normalizeWalletData(rawData, createDefaultLabelProvider());
const report = generateReport(context);

console.log('Risk:', report.overallRisk);
console.log('Signals:', report.signals.length);
```

### Web UI

## What It Detects

13 privacy heuristics analyze on-chain behavior:

| # | Heuristic | Severity | What it checks |
|---|-----------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Fee Payer Reuse | CRITICAL | One wallet paying fees for multiple accounts |
| 2 | Signer Overlap | HIGH | Same signers appearing across transactions |
| 3 | Memo Exposure | HIGH | Personal information in memo fields |
| 4 | Known Entity Interaction | HIGH | Transfers to/from exchanges, bridges, KYC services |
| 5 | Identity Metadata Exposure | HIGH | .sol domain and NFT metadata linkage |
| 6 | ATA Linkage | HIGH | One wallet funding token accounts for multiple owners |
| 7 | Address Reuse | MEDIUM | Using one address across many different protocols |
| 8 | Counterparty Reuse | MEDIUM | Repeated transfers to the same address |
| 9 | Instruction Fingerprinting | MEDIUM | Repeated program call patterns |
| 10 | Token Account Lifecycle | MEDIUM | Frequent create/close cycles |
| 11 | Priority Fee Fingerprinting | MEDIUM | Consistent priority fee amounts |
| 12 | Staking Delegation | MEDIUM | Concentrated validator delegation |
| 13 | Timing Patterns | MEDIUM | Burst activity and regular intervals |

The static code analyzer also detects fee payer reuse and memo PII in TypeScript/JavaScript source before deployment.

All heuristics are [fully documented](https://sps.guide/reports/heuristics) with examples and mitigation guidance.

## Developer Tools

### Static Code Analyzer

Catch privacy leaks before they reach the blockchain:

```bash
solana-privacy-scanner analyze src/ --json
```

Detects fee payer reuse in loops, PII in memo fields (emails, phone numbers, names), and `Buffer.from()` data sent to the Memo program.

### Claude Code Plugin

AI-powered privacy analysis inside Claude Code:

```
/scan-code          # Analyze source files
/scan-wallet        # Scan a wallet address
/explain-risk       # Explain a specific risk
/suggest-fix        # Get code fixes for issues
/privacy-audit      # Full repo audit
```

### CI/CD Integration

**See it in action:** [Example Repository](https://github.com/taylorferran/solana-privacy-scanner-example) with working PRs showing leak detection

```yaml
# .github/workflows/privacy-check.yml
- name: Privacy Scan
  run: |
    npx solana-privacy-scanner analyze src/ --json > report.json
    CRITICAL=$(jq '.summary.critical' report.json)
    [ "$CRITICAL" -eq 0 ] || exit 1
```

## What This Tool Is

- A diagnostic tool for measuring on-chain privacy exposure
- An educational resource for understanding blockchain privacy
- Open source software with documented, transparent heuristics

This tool does not deanonymize users. It analyzes privacy risk signals that already exist in public blockchain data.

## Infrastructure

Powered by **[QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/)** as a public good for the Solana ecosystem. No API keys, no setup, no configuration - privacy scanning just works.
