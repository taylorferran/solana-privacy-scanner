## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test -- --run
```

### Run Specific Test File
```bash
npm test -- packages/core/src/labels/provider.test.ts --run
```

### Run in Watch Mode
```bash
npm test
```

### Run with Coverage
```bash

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test file: `<component>.test.ts`
2. Use descriptive test names starting with "should"
3. Test both happy path and error cases
4. Update this TESTS.md file with new test descriptions

### Test Naming Convention
- Use `describe()` for grouping related tests
- Use `it()` or `test()` for individual test cases
- Start test names with "should" for clarity
- Be specific: "should detect Binance Hot Wallet 2" not "should work"

### Test Data
- Use realistic Solana addresses (base58, 32-44 chars)
- Use actual transaction signatures where possible
- Mock RPC responses consistently
- Keep test data in test files (avoid external fixtures for now)
